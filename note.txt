std::getline returns the input stream
    - the while loop terminates because when end of file is reached an EOF flag is set on the stream, loop evaluates to false

switch case statements:
    not putting 'break;' at a case will make execution fall through to consecutive cases.
        - the reason why you can have multiple cases which do the same task w/o copying task over

question:
why isspace take int and return int? should take char and return bool no?
