std::getline returns the input stream
    - the while loop terminates because when end of file is reached an EOF flag is set on the stream, loop evaluates to false

switch case statements:
    not putting 'break;' at a case will make execution fall through to consecutive cases.
        - the reason why you can have multiple cases which do the same task w/o copying task over

std::getline(stream, output) termination:
    -when it sees an EOF, the stream will set a flag.
        -still possible to get new values in output (all values after previous call and up to EOF)
            -subsequent calls will not put anything into output

need to define static member variables outside of class

question:
why isspace take int and return int? should take char and return bool no?
