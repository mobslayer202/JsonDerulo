std::getline returns the input stream
    - the while loop terminates because when end of file is reached an EOF flag is set on the stream, loop evaluates to false

switch case statements:
    not putting 'break;' at a case will make execution fall through to consecutive cases.
        - the reason why you can have multiple cases which do the same task w/o copying task over

std::getline(stream, output) termination:
    -when it sees an EOF, the stream will set a flag.
        -still possible to get new values in output (all values after previous call and up to EOF)
            -subsequent calls will not put anything into output

need to define static member variables outside of class but within "same namespace scope" of class - GPT

Reference return of operator++:
    enum class MyEnum {
        First,
        Second,
        Third,
        Count  // Always keep this as the last element
    };

    MyEnum& operator++(MyEnum& e) {
        if (e != MyEnum::Count) {
            e = static_cast<MyEnum>(static_cast<int>(e) + 1);
        }
        return e;
    }
Allows it to be used "immediately": (MyEnum d = ++e;) - GPT
The param makes it clear you incrementing MyEnum - GPT
    - FAKE NEWS, NO PARAM ALLOWED EXCEPT INT!!!

question:
why isspace take int and return int? should take char and return bool no?
why don't handle() functions red squiggly when no return?

data structure to represent the Json is weird
